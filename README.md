# The_Little_Taco_Shop
This HTML project is designed to create a simple website for "The Little Taco Shop,"

        The homepage of the website.
        Includes a navigation menu, an image with a caption, and sections for "About" and "Our Menu."
        Uses semantic HTML elements like <header>, <nav>, <article>, <figure>, and <footer>.
  2.contact.html:
        A contact page where users can fill out a form to send a message to the shop.
        Includes a form with fields for the user's name, email, and message.
        Contains an address section with the shop's location and phone number.
  3.hours.html:
        Displays the store hours of "The Little Taco Shop."
        Uses a <dl> element to list the days and hours of operation.
  4.styless.css:
        A CSS file that styles the HTML pages.
        Defines styles for the overall layout, including font size, margins, padding, and table borders.
